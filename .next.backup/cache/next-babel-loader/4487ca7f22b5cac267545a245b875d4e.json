MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONS TO THESE TERMS</Text>\n      \n      <Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">Emblem reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use the Service, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the terms incorporated therein by reference effective as of the date these Terms are updated. It is your sole responsibility to review the Terms from time to time to view such changes and to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply when you access or use the Service. We sometimes need to provide additional terms for specific services (and all such services are deemed part of the “Service” hereunder and shall also be subject to these Terms). Those additional terms and conditions, which are available in connection with the relevant service and hereby incorporated by reference, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any additional applicable terms we may provide for a specific service, such additional terms shall control for that specific service.</Text> \n\n      <Text m={25} fontWeight=\"bold\" fontSize=\"lg\">III. CAPACITY AND AUTHORITY TO USE THE SERVICES</Text>\n\n      <Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">You expressly represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into this agreement on behalf of yourself and any third-party individual or organization for which you are acting as an authorized agent. You expressly represent and warrant that you are over the age of majority in your jurisdiction and at least over the age of thirteen (13). If you are under eighteen (18) years old you may only use the Services through a parent or guardian’s Account and upon their separate agreement to these Terms. It is prohibited to use our Service if you are under 13 years old.</Text>\n\n      <Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">If you use our Services from or on behalf of a company, collective, digital autonomous\norganization (“DAO”), smart contract, or any other type of entity then “you” includes you and\nthat entity, and you represent and warrant that: (i) you are an authorized representative of the\nentity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, (ii) you are authorized by the entity to\ninitiate transactions and interact with our Smart Contracts from your digital wallet on behalf of\nthe entity; and (iii) you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf.

YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES</Text>\n\n    <Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">In addition to other responsibilities and obligations provided in these Terms, you are solely\nresponsible for evaluating, observing, and discharging any applicable legal obligations and\nrequirements that may apply to your voluntary use of the Services. Without limitation, you are\nsolely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your transactions and to withhold,\ncollect, report, and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Emblem\nis not responsible for determining, withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting the taxes that\napply to your assets held in or sold from your Vault. Further, you agree not to use our Services in\nany manner that could be violative of any applicable regulation. We strongly encourage you to\nseek the help of a competent legal and tax professional before making use of the Service.\nNothing in these Terms should be construed as legal advice, tax advice, investment advice, or a\nlegal opinion.</Text>\n\n    <Text m={25} fontWeight={\"bold\"} fontSize=\"lg\">V. THE VAULT SERVICES RELY ON PUBLIC BLOCKCHAINS AND OTHER EXPERIMENTAL\nTECHNOLOGIES</Text>\n\n  <Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">Our Services enable you to create personal Vaults that are represented as NFTs issued on the\nEthereum Blockchain. Our Site facilitates the generation, encryption, communication, storage\nand decryption of private-public key pairs for your Vault and for wallets on various public\nBlockchains (as designated by Emblem) that may be associated with your Vault.</Text>\n\n  <Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">Emblem’s Services enable you to voluntarily interact with experimental technologies, including\nthe blockchains, smart contracts, NFT(s), Ordinals, Vaults, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins.\nBlockchains are decentralized, open-source virtual machines or databases that utilize public-key\ncryptography and that are not under the direct control of Emblem or any specific third party.\nCertain blockchains enable the operation of automatically executable computer programs (i.e.,\n“Smart Contracts,” “decentralization application,” or “Dapps”) with functions that are\ndeterministic, publicly inspectable, and executed by an independent network transaction\nvalidators.</Text>\n\n  <Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">The Services depend to a large extent on such experimental technologies and are subject to many\nrisks, uncertainties, and possibly unknown security vulnerabilities. The Services, Smart\nContracts, and your digital wallet and assets may be the target of third-party attacks, including\nbut not limited to phishing, Sybil attacks, bruteforcing, inactive listing exploits, impersonations,\nor the use of viruses (“Third-Party Attacks”). Emblem will not be responsible or liable, directly\nor indirectly, for any actual or alleged loss or damage sustained by You in connection with\nThird-Party Attacks. Blockchain technologies and digital assets are also subject to many legal\nand regulatory uncertainties that could adversely impact the Services, which could impede or\nlimit your ability to continue the use and enjoyment of the Services or related assets and\ntechnologies. Emblem reserves the right to execute smart contract transactions as a buyer, Vault\ndeployer, or otherwise as an ordinary user.</Text>\n\n  <Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">Blockchains may require the payment of a transaction Fee (i.e., “Gas”) for transactions executed\nby our Smart Contracts. The value of the Fee changes, often unpredictably, and is entirely\noutside of Emblem. The User acknowledges that under no circumstances will a contract,\nagreement, offer, sale, bid, or other transaction involving our Smart Contracts be invalidated,\nrevocable, reversible, refundable, or otherwise unenforceable on the basis that the Fee for the\ngiven transaction was unknown, too high, or otherwise unacceptable to a User.</Text>\n\n  <Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">You acknowledge and agree that technologies that may be available through the Service are\nnovel, experimental, and speculative, and that therefore there is significant uncertainty regarding\nthe operation, effects, and security risks thereof, including uncertainty regarding the application\nof existing law to activities related thereto. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,\nEmblem disclaims any and all liability related to the foregoing experimental technologies and\nwith respect to its own role in facilitating your use of such experimental technologies. Without\nlimitation, Emblem disclaims any and all liability related to its role relating to generating,\nencrypting, decrypting, storing or communicating your private keys or other information related\nto the security of your Vault or assets.</Text>\n\n<Text m={25} fontWeight={\"bold\"} fontSize=\"lg\">VI. USERS CONSENTS TO THE AUTOMATED OPERATION OF SMART CONTRACTS</Text>\n\n<Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">You agree and understand that all transactions executed by you and all fees, assets, and NFTs\ntransferred by, received by, or claimed by you are processed and settled exclusively by the\napplicable public Blockchain - not Emblem. Emblem does not control any public blockchain.\nEmblem has no ability to reverse any transactions previously settled by the Ethereum blockchain.\nBy invoking or interacting with our Smart Contracts, you agree and irrevocably consent to the\nautomated processing of any authorized transactions, fees, operations, or functionalities enabled\nby them.</Text>\n\n<Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">You acknowledge and agree that the Smart Contracts may be subject to bugs, malfunctions,\ntiming errors, hacking and theft, vulnerabilities, or changes or errors of the applicable blockchain\n(including &quot;forks&quot;), which can adversely affect the Services, affect your property interests over\nyour digital assets, and may expose you to a risk of total loss or forfeiture of your digital assets.\nEmblem does not guarantee, and is not responsible for, your continued ownership over your\nVault, or assets held in your Vault, or your ability to exercise your rights with respect to digital\nassets held in your Vault or with respect to your use or enjoyment of our Services.</Text>\n\n<Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">You agree that you have reviewed, have had the chance to audit, and hereby approve the Smart\nContracts we enable you to interact with through the Site, including at least the Smart Contracts\nidentified in our developer documentation here: https://github.com/EmblemCompany and\nhttps://github.com/EmblemCompany/emblem-vault-solidity/blob/RC1.1/deployed-mainnet.json.</Text>\n\n<Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">By interacting with our Smart Contracts, whether on or off of the Site, you irrevocably consent to\nany foreseeable or unforeseeable function, operation, rule, parameter, or consequence enabled or\nrequired by the Smart Contract code.</Text>\n\n<Text m={25} fontWeight={\"bold\"} fontSize=\"lg\">VII. NON-RELIANCE</Text>\n\n<Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">You are knowledgeable, experienced, and sophisticated in using and evaluating blockchain and\nrelated technologies, cryptocurrency, digital assets, NFTs, Ordinals, Vaults, and Smart Contracts.\nYou represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice,\nand experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted\nvia the Services or any underlying digital asset.
