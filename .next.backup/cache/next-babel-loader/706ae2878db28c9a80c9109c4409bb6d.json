PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY AS THEY CONSTITUTE A BINDING LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND EMBLEM. ASPECTS OF THESE TERMS LIMIT CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA (AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION) RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. I. THIS IS A BINDING LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND EMBLEM These Terms of Service (\\u201CTerms\\u201D or \\u201CAgreement\\u201D) are entered into between You and Emblem. These Terms govern your access to and use of the Site(s), interaction with our Smart Contracts, Vaults, and any other software, websites, applications, API\\u2019s, webtools, third party tools, experiences, features, or functionalities provided on or in connection with the Site(s) and all successor Site(s) thereto (collectively, the \\u201CServices\\u201D). Without limitation, these Terms govern your voluntary use our Services for any purpose, including to deploy Non-Fungible Token (\\u201CNFT\\u201D) \\u201CVaults,\\u201D upload content, and configure, interact, or perform functions involving our Site or Smart Contracts. For the purposes of these Terms, \\u201Cyou\\u201D includes both you, the person or entity, and the digital wallet that you use for the purposes of using the services. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND REAFFIRM YOUR AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS EACH TIME YOU ACCESS THE SITE, USE THE SERVICES, LOG ONTO TO THE SITE, CONNECT YOUR DIGITAL WALLET THROUGH THE SITE, INITIATE TRANSACTIONS FROM YOUR DIGITAL WALLET THROUGH THE SITE, DEPLOY OR INTERACT WITH A VAULT, OR OTHERWISE INVOKE OR INTERACT WITH THE SITE. YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY AND PERMANENTLY DISCONTINUE YOUR ACCESS AND USE OF THE SITE IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS. II. MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONS TO THESE TERMS Emblem reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use the Service, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the terms incorporated therein by reference effective as of the date these Terms are updated. It is your sole responsibility to review the Terms from time to time to view such changes and to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply when you access or use the Service. We sometimes need to provide additional terms for specific services (and all such services are deemed part of the \\u201CService\\u201D hereunder and shall also be subject to these Terms). Those additional terms and conditions, which are available in connection with the relevant service and hereby incorporated by reference, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any additional applicable terms we may provide for a specific service, such additional terms shall control for that specific service. III. CAPACITY AND AUTHORITY TO USE THE SERVICES You expressly represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into this agreement on behalf of yourself and any third-party individual or organization for which you are acting as an authorized agent. You expressly represent and warrant that you are over the age of majority in your jurisdiction and at least over the age of thirteen (13). If you are under eighteen (18) years old you may only use the Services through a parent or guardian\\u2019s Account and upon their separate agreement to these Terms. It is prohibited to use our Service if you are under 13 years old. If you use our Services from or on behalf of a company, collective, digital autonomous organization (\\u201CDAO\\u201D), smart contract, or any other type of entity then \\u201Cyou\\u201D includes you and that entity, and you represent and warrant that: (i) you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, (ii) you are authorized by the entity to initiate transactions and interact with our Smart Contracts from your digital wallet on behalf of the entity; and (iii) you agree to these Terms on the entity\\u2019s behalf. If you utilize \\u201Cbots,\\u201D \\u201Cspiders,\\u201D \\u201Csmart contracts,\\u201D or other technical instruments or agents to use our Services, then \\u201Cyou\\u201D includes you and that technical instrument or agent. You bear all responsibility and liability stemming from the use of such technical instruments. IV. YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES In addition to other responsibilities and obligations provided in these Terms, you are solely responsible for evaluating, observing, and discharging any applicable legal obligations and requirements that may apply to your voluntary use of the Services. Without limitation, you are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your transactions and to withhold, collect, report, and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Emblem is not responsible for determining, withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting the taxes that apply to your assets held in or sold from your Vault. Further, you agree not to use our Services in any manner that could be violative of any applicable regulation. We strongly encourage you to seek the help of a competent legal and tax professional before making use of the Service. Nothing in these Terms should be construed as legal advice, tax advice, investment advice, or a legal opinion. V. THE VAULT SERVICES RELY ON PUBLIC BLOCKCHAINS AND OTHER EXPERIMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES Our Services enable you to create personal Vaults that are represented as NFTs issued on the Ethereum Blockchain. Our Site facilitates the generation, encryption, communication, storage and decryption of private-public key pairs for your Vault and for wallets on various public Blockchains (as designated by Emblem) that may be associated with your Vault. Emblem\\u2019s Services enable you to voluntarily interact with experimental technologies, including the blockchains, smart contracts, NFT(s), Ordinals, Vaults, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins. Blockchains are decentralized, open-source virtual machines or databases that utilize public-key cryptography and that are not under the direct control of Emblem or any specific third party. Certain blockchains enable the operation of automatically executable computer programs (i.e., \\u201CSmart Contracts,\\u201D \\u201Cdecentralization application,\\u201D or \\u201CDapps\\u201D) with functions that are deterministic, publicly inspectable, and executed by an independent network transaction validators. The Services depend to a large extent on such experimental technologies and are subject to many risks, uncertainties, and possibly unknown security vulnerabilities. The Services, Smart Contracts, and your digital wallet and assets may be the target of third-party attacks, including but not limited to phishing, Sybil attacks, bruteforcing, inactive listing exploits, impersonations, or the use of viruses (\\u201CThird-Party Attacks\\u201D). Emblem will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any actual or alleged loss or damage sustained by You in connection with Third-Party Attacks. Blockchain technologies and digital assets are also subject to many legal and regulatory uncertainties that could adversely impact the Services, which could impede or limit your ability to continue the use and enjoyment of the Services or related assets and technologies. Emblem reserves the right to execute smart contract transactions as a buyer, Vault deployer, or otherwise as an ordinary user. Blockchains may require the payment of a transaction Fee (i.e., \\u201CGas\\u201D) for transactions executed by our Smart Contracts. The value of the Fee changes, often unpredictably, and is entirely outside of Emblem. The User acknowledges that under no circumstances will a contract, agreement, offer, sale, bid, or other transaction involving our Smart Contracts be invalidated, revocable, reversible, refundable, or otherwise unenforceable on the basis that the Fee for the given transaction was unknown, too high, or otherwise unacceptable to a User. You acknowledge and agree that technologies that may be available through the Service are novel, experimental, and speculative, and that therefore there is significant uncertainty regarding the operation, effects, and security risks thereof, including uncertainty regarding the application of existing law to activities related thereto. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Emblem disclaims any and all liability related to the foregoing experimental technologies and with respect to its own role in facilitating your use of such experimental technologies. Without limitation, Emblem disclaims any and all liability related to its role relating to generating, encrypting, decrypting, storing or communicating your private keys or other information related to the security of your Vault or assets. VI. USERS CONSENTS TO THE AUTOMATED OPERATION OF SMART CONTRACTS You agree and understand that all transactions executed by you and all fees, assets, and NFTs transferred by, received by, or claimed by you are processed and settled exclusively by the applicable public Blockchain - not Emblem. Emblem does not control any public blockchain. Emblem has no ability to reverse any transactions previously settled by the Ethereum blockchain. By invoking or interacting with our Smart Contracts, you agree and irrevocably consent to the automated processing of any authorized transactions, fees, operations, or functionalities enabled by them. You acknowledge and agree that the Smart Contracts may be subject to bugs, malfunctions, timing errors, hacking and theft, vulnerabilities, or changes or errors of the applicable blockchain (including \\\"forks\\\"), which can adversely affect the Services, affect your property interests over your digital assets, and may expose you to a risk of total loss or forfeiture of your digital assets. Emblem does not guarantee, and is not responsible for, your continued ownership over your Vault, or assets held in your Vault, or your ability to exercise your rights with respect to digital assets held in your Vault or with respect to your use or enjoyment of our Services. You agree that you have reviewed, have had the chance to audit, and hereby approve the Smart Contracts we enable you to interact with through the Site, including at least the Smart Contracts identified in our developer documentation here: https://github.com/EmblemCompany and https://github.com/EmblemCompany/emblem-vault-solidity/blob/RC1.1/deployed-mainnet.json. By interacting with our Smart Contracts, whether on or off of the Site, you irrevocably consent to any foreseeable or unforeseeable function, operation, rule, parameter, or consequence enabled or required by the Smart Contract code. VII. NON-RELIANCE You are knowledgeable, experienced, and sophisticated in using and evaluating blockchain and related technologies, cryptocurrency, digital assets, NFTs, Ordinals, Vaults, and Smart Contracts. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice, and experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted via the Services or any underlying digital asset. You have conducted your own thorough independent investigation and analysis of the Services and Smart Contracts and the other matters contemplated by these Terms. You have not relied up-on any information, statement, omission, representation, or warranty, express or implied, written or oral, made by or on behalf of Emblem in connection therewith, except as expressly set forth by Emblem in these Terms. VIII. ACCESSING AND USING THE SERVICE To create an Account and enjoy full functionality of our Services you must connect your third- party digital wallet.

You may be required to authenticate ownership of your digital wallet before you can perform transactions through the Services by cryptographically verifying, through your third-party wallet provider, your possession of the digital wallet\\u2019s associated private key. You are to only use your digital wallet under the terms and conditions established by your third party-wallet provider. Your digital wallet and all assets held therein are your personal property, and not the property of Emblem.

In such cases, Emblem, in its sole discretion, may disable your Account and block your ability to access the Service until such additional information and documents are processed by Emblem. XV. THE EMBLEM VAULTS The Emblem Vaults are user-generated NFTs that may be controlled, modified, transferred, and claimed by the Vault owner (ownership is determined by the Ethereum blockchain). The Emblem Vaults can be configured with several different addresses from many different blockchains that are capable of receiving, but not sending, assets available on the respective blockchains. If a Vault transferred, all assets held within the Vault are necessarily transferred with it. Emblem Vaults and assets held therein are only claimable by the authenticated Vault Owner. Once claimed, the private key associated with a Vault is necessarily exposed to the claiming party, allowing that party to claim all the asset held inside the Vault and rendering that Vault unsafe for use by anyone else. You must investigate on your own whether a Vault has been previously claimed or not. Emblem makes no representations or warranties so to, or assumes no duty or obligation to warn you of, the status, security, or risks associated with a given Vault. Your ordinary use of the Services does not require you to give Emblem sole possession, custody, or control of your digital wallet, your deployed Vault, your NFTs or other assets held in your Vault. As a technical service provider, Emblem may exercise some control over your Vault for the sake of facilitating your experience or protecting other Users, but Emblem will not generally interfere with your lawful ownership of your Vault. Emblem is not a wallet provider, Vault exchange, broker, financial institution, money services business, or creditor. You cannot sell or transfer Vaults through the Site. Emblem is not party to any agreement or transactions involving you and other users or assets, whether or or off of the Site. However, Emblem may receive fees for sales of Vaults on third party marketplaces as otherwise enabled in the deployed Smart Contract code (discussed further below). YOU DEPLOY, VIEW, TRANSFER, AND BUY VAULTS AT YOUR OWN RISK, WHETHER ON OR OFF OF THE SITE. EMBLEM DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE TITLE, SECURITY, OR AUTHENTICTIY OF ANY VAULT AVAILABLE ON THE SITE. EMBLEM ASSUMES NO OBLIGATION TO WARN YOU OF OR PUT YOU ON NOTICE OF THE POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES OR RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY GIVEN VAULT. XVI. FEES Emblem may impose a Vault deployment fee payable in $COVAL specified on the Site in association with your Vault deployment. All fees paid to Emblem are non-refundable and irreversible. Emblem reserves the absolute discretion and right to change the Vault deployment fee amount or the type of acceptable currency payable as a Vault deployment fee. As provided by the Smart Contracts, Emblem may receive a fee for sales or transfers of your Vault. You irrevocably consent to these fees when you deploy a Vault and again when you transfer or sell a Vault on a third party marketplace. Emblem reserves the right to identify itself as a recipient of royalties or creator fees to third party marketplaces that facilitate the sale of your Vaults. XVII. $COVAL The $COVAL (\\u201CCircuits of Value\\u201D) token is an ERC-20 token (or cryptocurrency) created and governed by the protocol smart contract: 0x3D658390460295FB963f54dC0899cfb1c30776Df. In its current form, $COVAL represents a unit of utility that provides you access to certain functionalities within the Emblem ecosystem, including the ability to deploy your personal Vault. $COVAL token holders are not entitled to profits and losses, no rights to distributions and dividends, and no rights of ownership to the Emblem company, or any other entity. $COVAL token holders have no possessory interest, title, deed, economic right, or claim to any capital, equity, endeavor, venture, or commercial entity, including Emblem. $COVAL tokens do not represent an investment contract, a commercial contract, debenture, equity interest, option, or a contract of any kind. You only need to purchase $COVAL to the extent it enables you to access certain goods and services made available through our Site or Smart Contracts. You should never buy $COVAL as a speculative investment product. XVIII. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES The Services may include hyperlinks, options, and tools to access, purchase, or interact with other third-party websites, resources, block explorers, wallet providers, Ordinal-related services providers, smart contracts, products, materials, applications, or information (collectively, \\u201CThird- Party Services\\u201D).

YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR EVALUATING THE AUTHENTICITY OF, WARRANTIES, PROMISES, OR INFORMATION UPLOADED BY OTHER USERS IN ASSOCIATION WITH THEIR DEPLOYED VAULTS. XXI.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the maximum aggregate liability of Emblem arising out of or in any way related to these terms, the access to and use of the Service, content, NFTs, Vaults, or any of Emblem\\u2019s products or services exceed the greater of (a) $100 or (b) the amount directly received by Emblem for its service directly relating to the assets that are the subject of the claim. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions also limit disclaimers or limitations of liability for personal injury from consumer products, so this limitation may not apply to personal injury claims. XXVIII. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT & WAIVER OF CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS Please read this section carefully because it limits certain rights, including the right to maintain a court action, the right to a jury trial, the right to participate in any form of class or representative claim, the right to engage in discovery except as provided in AAA (American Arbitration Association) rules, and the right to certain remedies and forms of relief. Other rights that you or Emblem would have in court also may not be available in arbitration. This section does not govern disputes between users or between users and third parties. Emblem does not provide dispute resolution services for such disagreements and the parties must resolve those disputes directly. A. YOU AND EMBLEM AGREE TO BINDING ARBITRATION AND TO WAIVE A JURY TRIAL You and Emblem agree to resolve any disputes between us through binding and final arbitration, other than claims that qualify to be brought in small claims court. You waive your right to any jury trial of any claim against Emblem and its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, assigns, affiliates, shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, agents and licensors. Emblem waives its right to any jury trial of any claim against you. Any and all disputes, controversies, claims and counterclaims, arising between You and Emblem of any type or nature whatsoever, including but not limited to those relating to these Terms of Service, our Services, an NFT, your Smart Contracts, or any transaction conducted through the Services, other than those that qualify to be brought in small claims court,\\xA0(\\u201CDisputes\\u201D) must be submitted for binding arbitration under the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\\u201CAAA Rules\\u201D). But first, You and Emblem both agree to engage in good-faith efforts to resolve disputes prior to either party initiating an arbitration, small claims court proceeding, or equitable relief for intellectual property infringement. The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator, who may decide whether a dispute is subject to arbitration, and whose decision on all issues will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. \\xA0You and Emblem agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by\\xA0applicable\\xA0disclosure rules and regulations of securities, regulatory authorities, or other governmental agencies. This arbitration agreement does not preclude You or Emblem from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies consistent with these Terms. Specifically, the right of You and Emblem may bring qualifying claims in small claims court. \\xA0In addition, You or Emblem may ask any court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration of any dispute, other than one that qualifies to be filed in small claims court, or to enforce the arbitrator\\u2019s award. Other than small claims actions and actions to compel arbitration or enforce the arbitrator\\u2019s award, Emblem and You must arbitrate all Disputes. B. ARBITRATION COSTS If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Emblem will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. \\xA0In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate. C. CLASS ACTION WAIVER You may not act as a class representative nor participate as a class member of any class claimants with respect to any claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class, collective, or representative basis.\\xA0 You may only bring individual claims, and the arbitrator may only decide individual claims. \\xA0The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. XXIX. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE These Terms and your access to and use of the Service shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Delaware (without regard to conflict of law rules or principles of Delaware, or any other jurisdiction that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction). Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration as set forth herein or cannot be heard in small claims court, shall be resolved in the state or federal courts of Delaware. XXX. TERMINATION If you breach any of the provisions of these Terms, all licenses and privileges granted by Emblem will terminate automatically. Additionally, notwithstanding anything contained in these Terms, we reserve the right, with or without notice and in our sole discretion, to suspend, disable, terminate, or delete your Account and/or your ability to access or use the Service (or any part of the foregoing) at any time and for any or no reason, and you acknowledge and agree that we shall have no liability or obligation to you in such event and that you will not be entitled to a refund of any amounts that you have already paid to us. XXXI. SEVERABILITY If any term, clause, or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause, or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause, or provision, or any other term, clause, or provision of these Terms. XXXII. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF You agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to Emblem for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and Emblem shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security, or proof of damages. XXXIII. EXPORT LAWS You agree that you will not export or re-export, directly or indirectly, the Service, a Vault, and/or other information or materials provided by Emblem hereunder, to any country for which the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction requires any export license or other governmental approval at the time of export without first obtaining such license or approval. In particular, but without limitation, the Service may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries or any country that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a \\u201Cterrorist supporting\\u201D country, or (b) to anyone listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties, including the U.S. Treasury Department\\u2019s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Person\\u2019s List or Entity List. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You are responsible for and hereby agree to comply at your sole expense with all applicable United States export laws and regulations. XXXIV. SURVIVAL All sections which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding any termination of these Terms by Emblem or you. Termination will not limit any of Emblem\\u2019s other rights or remedies at law or in equity. XXXV. MISCELLANEOUS These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Emblem relating to your access to and use of the Service. Emblem\\u2019s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for reference only and shall not be read to have any legal effect. We reserve the right to assign our rights without restriction, including without limitation to any Emblem Party, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with Emblem. In the event that Emblem is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. You may not assign any rights and/or licenses granted under this Agreement. Any attempted transfer or assignment by you in violation hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns. The Service is operated by us in the United States. Those who choose to access the Service from locations outside the United States do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. Emblem reserves the restrict to restrict or prevent your access to the Services based on your location. You and Emblem agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the interpretation or construction of these Terms. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.

We sometimes need to provide additional terms for specific services\n(and all such services are deemed part of the “Service” hereunder and shall also be subject to\nthese Terms). Those additional terms and conditions, which are available in connection with the\nrelevant service and hereby incorporated by reference, then become part of your agreement with\nus if you use those Services. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any additional\napplicable terms we may provide for a specific service, such additional terms shall control for\nthat specific service.\nIII. CAPACITY AND AUTHORITY TO USE THE SERVICES\nYou expressly represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into\nthis agreement on behalf of yourself and any third-party individual or organization for which you\nare acting as an authorized agent. You expressly represent and warrant that you are over the age\nof majority in your jurisdiction and at least over the age of thirteen (13). If you are under\neighteen (18) years old you may only use the Services through a parent or guardian’s Account\nand upon their separate agreement to these Terms. It is prohibited to use our Service if you are\nunder 13 years old.\nIf you use our Services from or on behalf of a company, collective, digital autonomous\norganization (“DAO”), smart contract, or any other type of entity then “you” includes you and\nthat entity, and you represent and warrant that: (i) you are an authorized representative of the\nentity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, (ii) you are authorized by the entity to\ninitiate transactions and interact with our Smart Contracts from your digital wallet on behalf of\nthe entity; and (iii) you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf.

YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES\nIn addition to other responsibilities and obligations provided in these Terms, you are solely\nresponsible for evaluating, observing, and discharging any applicable legal obligations and\nrequirements that may apply to your voluntary use of the Services. Without limitation, you are\nsolely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your transactions and to withhold,\ncollect, report, and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Emblem\nis not responsible for determining, withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting the taxes that\napply to your assets held in or sold from your Vault. Further, you agree not to use our Services in\nany manner that could be violative of any applicable regulation. We strongly encourage you to\nseek the help of a competent legal and tax professional before making use of the Service.\nNothing in these Terms should be construed as legal advice, tax advice, investment advice, or a\nlegal opinion.\n\nV. THE VAULT SERVICES RELY ON PUBLIC BLOCKCHAINS AND OTHER EXPERIMENTAL\nTECHNOLOGIES\nOur Services enable you to create personal Vaults that are represented as NFTs issued on the\nEthereum Blockchain. Our Site facilitates the generation, encryption, communication, storage\nand decryption of private-public key pairs for your Vault and for wallets on various public\nBlockchains (as designated by Emblem) that may be associated with your Vault.\nEmblem’s Services enable you to voluntarily interact with experimental technologies, including\nthe blockchains, smart contracts, NFT(s), Ordinals, Vaults, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins.\nBlockchains are decentralized, open-source virtual machines or databases that utilize public-key\ncryptography and that are not under the direct control of Emblem or any specific third party.\nCertain blockchains enable the operation of automatically executable computer programs (i.e.,\n“Smart Contracts,” “decentralization application,” or “Dapps”) with functions that are\ndeterministic, publicly inspectable, and executed by an independent network transaction\nvalidators.\nThe Services depend to a large extent on such experimental technologies and are subject to many\nrisks, uncertainties, and possibly unknown security vulnerabilities. The Services, Smart\nContracts, and your digital wallet and assets may be the target of third-party attacks, including\nbut not limited to phishing, Sybil attacks, bruteforcing, inactive listing exploits, impersonations,\nor the use of viruses (“Third-Party Attacks”). Emblem will not be responsible or liable, directly\nor indirectly, for any actual or alleged loss or damage sustained by You in connection with\nThird-Party Attacks. Blockchain technologies and digital assets are also subject to many legal\nand regulatory uncertainties that could adversely impact the Services, which could impede or\nlimit your ability to continue the use and enjoyment of the Services or related assets and\ntechnologies. Emblem reserves the right to execute smart contract transactions as a buyer, Vault\ndeployer, or otherwise as an ordinary user.\nBlockchains may require the payment of a transaction Fee (i.e., “Gas”) for transactions executed\nby our Smart Contracts. The value of the Fee changes, often unpredictably, and is entirely\noutside of Emblem. The User acknowledges that under no circumstances will a contract,\nagreement, offer, sale, bid, or other transaction involving our Smart Contracts be invalidated,\nrevocable, reversible, refundable, or otherwise unenforceable on the basis that the Fee for the\ngiven transaction was unknown, too high, or otherwise unacceptable to a User.\nYou acknowledge and agree that technologies that may be available through the Service are\nnovel, experimental, and speculative, and that therefore there is significant uncertainty regarding\nthe operation, effects, and security risks thereof, including uncertainty regarding the application\nof existing law to activities related thereto. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,\nEmblem disclaims any and all liability related to the foregoing experimental technologies and\nwith respect to its own role in facilitating your use of such experimental technologies. Without\nlimitation, Emblem disclaims any and all liability related to its role relating to generating,\nencrypting, decrypting, storing or communicating your private keys or other information related\nto the security of your Vault or assets.\nVI. USERS CONSENTS TO THE AUTOMATED OPERATION OF SMART CONTRACTS\n\nYou agree and understand that all transactions executed by you and all fees, assets, and NFTs\ntransferred by, received by, or claimed by you are processed and settled exclusively by the\napplicable public Blockchain - not Emblem. Emblem does not control any public blockchain.\nEmblem has no ability to reverse any transactions previously settled by the Ethereum blockchain.\nBy invoking or interacting with our Smart Contracts, you agree and irrevocably consent to the\nautomated processing of any authorized transactions, fees, operations, or functionalities enabled\nby them.\nYou acknowledge and agree that the Smart Contracts may be subject to bugs, malfunctions,\ntiming errors, hacking and theft, vulnerabilities, or changes or errors of the applicable blockchain\n(including &quot;forks&quot;), which can adversely affect the Services, affect your property interests over\nyour digital assets, and may expose you to a risk of total loss or forfeiture of your digital assets.\nEmblem does not guarantee, and is not responsible for, your continued ownership over your\nVault, or assets held in your Vault, or your ability to exercise your rights with respect to digital\nassets held in your Vault or with respect to your use or enjoyment of our Services.\nYou agree that you have reviewed, have had the chance to audit, and hereby approve the Smart\nContracts we enable you to interact with through the Site, including at least the Smart Contracts\nidentified in our developer documentation here: https://github.com/EmblemCompany and\nhttps://github.com/EmblemCompany/emblem-vault-solidity/blob/RC1.1/deployed-mainnet.json.\nBy interacting with our Smart Contracts, whether on or off of the Site, you irrevocably consent to\nany foreseeable or unforeseeable function, operation, rule, parameter, or consequence enabled or\nrequired by the Smart Contract code.\nVII. NON-RELIANCE\nYou are knowledgeable, experienced, and sophisticated in using and evaluating blockchain and\nrelated technologies, cryptocurrency, digital assets, NFTs, Ordinals, Vaults, and Smart Contracts.\nYou represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice,\nand experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted\nvia the Services or any underlying digital asset. You have conducted your own thorough\nindependent investigation and analysis of the Services and Smart Contracts and the other matters\ncontemplated by these Terms. You have not relied up-on any information, statement, omission,\nrepresentation, or warranty, express or implied, written or oral, made by or on behalf of Emblem\nin connection therewith, except as expressly set forth by Emblem in these Terms.\nVIII. ACCESSING AND USING THE SERVICE\nTo create an Account and enjoy full functionality of our Services you must connect your third-\nparty digital wallet. By connecting your wallet to the Site, you expressly represent that you are\nthe lawful and rightful owner of the digital wallet and that you are solely responsible for\nmaintaining the security of your wallet and your control over any wallet-related authentication\ncredentials, private or public cryptocurrency keys, and non-fungible tokens or cryptocurrencies\nthat are stored in or are accessible through your wallet. You may be required to authenticate\nownership of your digital wallet before you can perform transactions through the Services by\ncryptographically verifying, through your third-party wallet provider, your possession of the\n\ndigital wallet’s associated private key. You are to only use your digital wallet under the terms\nand conditions established by your third party-wallet provider. Your digital wallet and all assets\nheld therein are your personal property, and not the property of Emblem. Emblem has no ability -\nand assumes no responsibility or obligation to - manage, modify, secure, or perform transactions\non behalf of your digital wallet.\nIX. YOUR WALLET IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY\nYou are solely and exclusively responsible for the security and management of your digital\nwallet(s). For your safety and the safety of other Users, you agree to maintain reasonable security\nmeasures over your digital wallets’ private keys, make best efforts to avoid potential scams\nwhich may compromise the security of your wallet or others, and to preserve the upmost secrecy\nof your digital wallet’s private key, seedphrase, your Account details, passwords, and any other\ninformation that you use to access your digital wallet or the Account. You are solely responsible\nfor ensuring that your digital wallet will not be used by any unauthorized person(s) or entities.\nEmblem accepts no responsibility for, and disclaims all liability to you, in connection with the\nsecurity of or your use of your digital wallet and disclaims any responsibility or obligation to\nassist or remedy you in the event of a breach of your digital wallet’s security. We are not liable\nfor any acts or omissions by you in connection with your digital wallet or as a result of your\ndigital wallet being compromised. Further, you agree that you may be liable to Emblem, other\nUsers, or other third parties for harm or losses arising from acts or omissions by you related to\nthe security of your digital wallet.\nYou agree to notify us immediately of any actual or suspected breach of security, loss, theft, or\nunauthorized use of your digital wallet or Account at hello@emblem.pro.\nX.

To the extent that we suggest that you “own” a Vault, your ownership\ninterest is a limited property interest in the actual instances of the Vaults actually deployed by\nyour digital wallet in connection with your use of our Services, and not an intellectual property\ninterest or assignment in the underlying Smart Contracts or code. Any use of Emblem’s\nMaterials other than as specifically authorized herein is strictly prohibited.

THE EMBLEM VAULTS\nThe Emblem Vaults are user-generated NFTs that may be controlled, modified, transferred, and\nclaimed by the Vault owner (ownership is determined by the Ethereum blockchain). The\nEmblem Vaults can be configured with several different addresses from many different\nblockchains that are capable of receiving, but not sending, assets available on the respective\nblockchains. If a Vault transferred, all assets held within the Vault are necessarily transferred\nwith it. Emblem Vaults and assets held therein are only claimable by the authenticated Vault\nOwner. Once claimed, the private key associated with a Vault is necessarily exposed to the\nclaiming party, allowing that party to claim all the asset held inside the Vault and rendering that\nVault unsafe for use by anyone else. You must investigate on your own whether a Vault has been\npreviously claimed or not. Emblem makes no representations or warranties so to, or assumes no\nduty or obligation to warn you of, the status, security, or risks associated with a given Vault.\nYour ordinary use of the Services does not require you to give Emblem sole possession, custody,\nor control of your digital wallet, your deployed Vault, your NFTs or other assets held in your\nVault.

As provided\nby the Smart Contracts, Emblem may receive a fee for sales or transfers of your Vault. You\nirrevocably consent to these fees when you deploy a Vault and again when you transfer or sell a\nVault on a third party marketplace. Emblem reserves the right to identify itself as a recipient of\nroyalties or creator fees to third party marketplaces that facilitate the sale of your Vaults.\nXVII. $COVAL\nThe $COVAL (“Circuits of Value”) token is an ERC-20 token (or cryptocurrency) created and\ngoverned by the protocol smart contract: 0x3D658390460295FB963f54dC0899cfb1c30776Df.\nIn its current form, $COVAL represents a unit of utility that provides you access to certain\nfunctionalities within the Emblem ecosystem, including the ability to deploy your personal\nVault. $COVAL token holders are not entitled to profits and losses, no rights to distributions and\ndividends, and no rights of ownership to the Emblem company, or any other entity. $COVAL\ntoken holders have no possessory interest, title, deed, economic right, or claim to any capital,\nequity, endeavor, venture, or commercial entity, including Emblem. $COVAL tokens do not\nrepresent an investment contract, a commercial contract, debenture, equity interest, option, or a\ncontract of any kind.

Other rights that you or Emblem would have in court also may not be available in\narbitration. This section does not govern disputes between users or between users and third\n\nparties. Emblem does not provide dispute resolution services for such disagreements and\nthe parties must resolve those disputes directly.\nA. YOU AND EMBLEM AGREE TO BINDING ARBITRATION AND TO WAIVE A JURY TRIAL\nYou and Emblem agree to resolve any disputes between us through binding and final arbitration,\nother than claims that qualify to be brought in small claims court.

But first, You and Emblem both agree to engage in good-faith efforts to resolve\ndisputes prior to either party initiating an arbitration, small claims court proceeding, or equitable\nrelief for intellectual property infringement. The arbitration will be heard and determined by a\nsingle arbitrator, who may decide whether a dispute is subject to arbitration, and whose decision\non all issues will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of\ncompetent jurisdiction.  You and Emblem agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and\nthat the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any\npleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral\nsubmissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may\nlawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure\nrules and regulations of securities, regulatory authorities, or other governmental agencies.\nThis arbitration agreement does not preclude You or Emblem from seeking action by federal,\nstate, or local government agencies consistent with these Terms. Specifically, the right of You\nand Emblem may bring qualifying claims in small claims court.  In addition, You or Emblem\nmay ask any court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration of any dispute, other than one\nthat qualifies to be filed in small claims court, or to enforce the arbitrator’s award. Other than\nsmall claims actions and actions to compel arbitration or enforce the arbitrator’s award, Emblem\nand You must arbitrate all Disputes.\nB. ARBITRATION COSTS\nIf you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of\nlitigation, Emblem will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator fees required for\nthe arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being\nprohibitive.  In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the\ncompensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems\nappropriate.\nC. CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nYou may not act as a class representative nor participate as a class member of any class\nclaimants with respect to any claim.
