THE VAULT SERVICES RELY ON PUBLIC BLOCKCHAINS AND OTHER EXPERIMENTAL\nTECHNOLOGIES</Text>\n\n  <Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">Our Services enable you to create personal Vaults that are represented as NFTs issued on the\nEthereum Blockchain. Our Site facilitates the generation, encryption, communication, storage\nand decryption of private-public key pairs for your Vault and for wallets on various public\nBlockchains (as designated by Emblem) that may be associated with your Vault.</Text>\n\n  <Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">Emblem’s Services enable you to voluntarily interact with experimental technologies, including\nthe blockchains, smart contracts, NFT(s), Ordinals, Vaults, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins.\nBlockchains are decentralized, open-source virtual machines or databases that utilize public-key\ncryptography and that are not under the direct control of Emblem or any specific third party.\nCertain blockchains enable the operation of automatically executable computer programs (i.e.,\n“Smart Contracts,” “decentralization application,” or “Dapps”) with functions that are\ndeterministic, publicly inspectable, and executed by an independent network transaction\nvalidators.</Text>\n\n  <Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">The Services depend to a large extent on such experimental technologies and are subject to many\nrisks, uncertainties, and possibly unknown security vulnerabilities. The Services, Smart\nContracts, and your digital wallet and assets may be the target of third-party attacks, including\nbut not limited to phishing, Sybil attacks, bruteforcing, inactive listing exploits, impersonations,\nor the use of viruses (“Third-Party Attacks”). Emblem will not be responsible or liable, directly\nor indirectly, for any actual or alleged loss or damage sustained by You in connection with\nThird-Party Attacks. Blockchain technologies and digital assets are also subject to many legal\nand regulatory uncertainties that could adversely impact the Services, which could impede or\nlimit your ability to continue the use and enjoyment of the Services or related assets and\ntechnologies. Emblem reserves the right to execute smart contract transactions as a buyer, Vault\ndeployer, or otherwise as an ordinary user.</Text>\n\n  <Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">Blockchains may require the payment of a transaction Fee (i.e., “Gas”) for transactions executed\nby our Smart Contracts. The value of the Fee changes, often unpredictably, and is entirely\noutside of Emblem. The User acknowledges that under no circumstances will a contract,\nagreement, offer, sale, bid, or other transaction involving our Smart Contracts be invalidated,\nrevocable, reversible, refundable, or otherwise unenforceable on the basis that the Fee for the\ngiven transaction was unknown, too high, or otherwise unacceptable to a User.</Text>\n\n  <Text m={25} fontSize=\"lg\">You acknowledge and agree that technologies that may be available through the Service are\nnovel, experimental, and speculative, and that therefore there is significant uncertainty regarding\nthe operation, effects, and security risks thereof, including uncertainty regarding the application\nof existing law to activities related thereto. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,\nEmblem disclaims any and all liability related to the foregoing experimental technologies and\nwith respect to its own role in facilitating your use of such experimental technologies.
