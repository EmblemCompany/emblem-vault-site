Although the token is publicly traded, it was not intended as an investment vehicle. This understanding is crucial as it underpins the core principles that guide our operations."}),(0,n.jsx)(r.x,{m:25,fontSize:"lg",children:"Our journey so far has seen a number of potential products proposed, including staking options and an NFT marketplace.

Starting today, we are introducing a new purchase model for creating vaults.

This upgrade aims to streamline the process of purchasing vaults."}),(0,n.jsx)(r.x,{m:25,fontSize:"lg",children:"Additionally, we're introducing a tiered discount mechanism within this new model. Here's how it works: Users who hold specified amounts of Coval in their wallets at the time of purchase can earn discounts on the final ETH price. For example, holding 50,000 Coval might entitle the purchaser to a 20% discount, while holding 100,000 Coval could offer a 30% discount. These are illustrative examples and actual discount tiers will be announced separately."}),(0,n.jsx)(r.x,{m:25,fontSize:"lg",children:"This new model unlocks a host of possibilities, including enabling our partners to mint vaults within their applications.
